In k8s, native applications can use the Endpoints API for access. Non-native applications can use a Virtual IP-based bridge
to access back end pods. ServiceTypes Type could be:
• ClusterIP default - exposes on a cluster-internal IP. Only reachable within cluster
• NodePort Exposes node IP at a static port. A ClusterIP is also automatically created.
• LoadBalancer Exposes service externally using cloud providers load balancer. NodePort and ClusterIP automatically created.
• ExternalName Maps service to contents of externalName using a CNAME record

If CIDR range differs from nodes range, connecting to pod without exposing NodePort will be impossible.

In order to connect with pod, these steps needs to be done:
1. Expose app with type NodePort
`kubectl -n accounting expose deployment nginx-one --type=NodePort`
2. Describe services in namespace where our desired app is:
`k -n accounting describe services`
3. Find randomly generated port
4. Find route to pod
`route -n`
5. Curl to app using found route from step 4. and randomly generated port from 3.
